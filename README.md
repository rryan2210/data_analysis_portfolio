# DATA ANALYST POTFOLIO
Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!

I am a Data Analyst with experience in using various tools and technologies to collect, organize, and analyze data to inform business decisions. With ten years' experience in the media industry as a Business Analyst (at Sony Pictures, Discovery Channel and ITN), I am also expert at statistical analysis, data visualisation, reporting and presenting to enable and inform business decisions, as well as managing stakeholder relationships. An advanced Excel, Power BI and Tableau user, with up-to-date competencies in Python, SQL and R for data analysis, I have a solid understanding of data analytics techniques such as dashboard building, report writing, data cleaning, statistics, and critical thinking.

In this portfolio, I have included a variety of projects that showcase my data analytics skills. You will find links of the dashboards and reports I have created using various tools such as Power BI, Tableau, and Excel. These projects demonstrate my ability to analyze and present data in a clear and visually appealing way, making it easy for decision makers to understand the insights and take action.

I have also included my work in programming languages such as Python, SQL and R. These projects showcase my ability to extract valuable insights from large and complex data sets, and to combine data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive view of the data.

In addition to my technical skills, I also pride myself on my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I am able to approach data analysis with a strategic mindset, and to identify key issues and opportunities in the data.

I am confident that my data analytics skills and experience make me an ideal candidate for any data analyst role. I hope you find my portfolio to be informative and engaging, and I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications further with you.

Thank you for your time, I look forward to hearing from you soon.
